    Declare a vector(or Array list), say v to store values of all nodes of the linked list.
    Iterate over the linked list and for each node, push the value of the node in v.
    After iterating over the entire linked list, find the middle index of the vector, say middleIdx = v.size()/2.
    Return v[middleIdx] as the middle element of the linked list.
